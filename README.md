# Bulgarian LGBT History
Everything is in the [wiki](https://github.com/mechachki/bg_lgbt/wiki)

# Long term plans
This repository is still obviously very tiny. I am working on getting more information, if you have any - submit a pull request or [email me](mailto:bg_lgbt@ddimitrov.nl).

It is my intention to eventually turn it into a website instead of just a GitHub wiki.

# Short term plans
I am currently waiting for the delivery of 'Foxy Ferdinand: Tsar of Bulgaria' by Stephen Constant. I intend to digitalize the book as no e-book copies seem to exist as of yet and host it in this repository, as well as put relevant excerpts in the wiki.

# Disclaimer

I do not intend to make money with this project. The distribution of all materials is with the intent to educate people and stop anti-LGBT propaganda claiming that 'LGBT people are a modern invention of the west' and 'back in the day there were no f*****s'.
